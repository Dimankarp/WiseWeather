## What is it all about?
*WiseWeather* is a litte WPF-application, designed to  help users start their mornings(frankly, any part of the day) by providing current weather at user's location, along side with
 a short motivational, but always wise quote!

## Where do we fetch data?
The application, obviously, requires an internet connection to function properly and to get all the needed data(otherwise you just get a fanct clock).

To get current weather, WiseWeather use [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org),

But OpenWeather request also requires *user city* for it to get particular data,
for that matter, WiseWeather also use [IpData API](https://dashboard.ipdata.co)

Finally, WiseWeather gets amazing *Quotes Of The Day* from [The Quote Garden](https://www.quotegarden.com/).
